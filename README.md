# University of Chicago - Masters Coursework

This repository contains coursework, projects, and assignments completed as part of my Master's program in Applied Data Science at the University of Chicago. Projects span NLP, time series forecasting, machine learning, MLOps, and more - applying real-world datasets and production-oriented tools.

## Courses & Projects

### 🧠 Natural Lanugage Processing
- **Project**: Analyzed ~200,000 news articles to assess AI’s impact on the workforce.
- **Approach**: Applied regex-based text cleaning, BERTopic modeling, SpaCy NER, and sentiment analysis (SiEBERT/RoBERTa).
- **Tools**: SpaCy, Hugging Face, PyTorch, TensorFlow, BERT, GPT.
- **Output**: Strategic recommendations on AI policy, investment, and workforce retraining.

### 📈 Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
- **Projects**:
  - Analyzed Brooklyn housing prices (2016–2020) using OLS, ANOVA, PCA, and linear modeling in R.
  - Forecasted U.S. monthly job openings using ARIMA, exponential smoothing, NNAR, and RNNs.
- **Models compared**: ETS, seasonal naive, regression with ARIMA errors, vector autoregressive models.

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- **Project**: Built a deep learning-based restaurant recommender system using Yelp data
- **Techniques**: Compared content-based filtering (KNN) and collaborative filter (SVD), selecting SVD with Ridge Regularization
- **Focus**: Model evaluation, matrix factorization

### 📊 Data Mining
- **Project**: Predicted 10-year coronary heart disease risk
- **Workflow**: Used ensemble classifiers, SHAP for model interpretability, logistic regression with RFE, and PCA for EDA
- **Languages**: Python and R

### 📉 Linear & Nonlinear Models
- **Project**: Modeled Airbnb listing prices using lienar and hierarchical models
- **Methods**: PCA, RFE, mixed effects models by neighborhood and city, SHAP values for interpretation
- **Findings**: Neighborhood-level effects were more predictive than city-level; key features included room type and accomodation size

### 🐦 Capstone: Avian Collision Detection _(Code not public)_
- **Client**: Argonne National Laboratory
- **Project**: Developed a BiLSTM-CNN fusion model to detect bird collisions using tabular sensor and image data.
- **Workflow**: Collaborated across three GitHub repos (two client-owned, one internal).
- **Note**: Project code is excluded due to NDA.

## Repository Structure

Each course has its own folder containing:
- Assignment notebooks
- Final project code and reports
